Guided Project: Popular Data Science Questions

Context: 

We are working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest. 
We need to figure out what is best content to write about. 

The question we are trying to answer is: "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" 

Some of the resources we can use for this are Stack Overflow and [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/tour). There are quit a few Stack Exchange websites that are relevant to our goal: 
- [Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)
- [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.stackexchange.com/)
- [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Database Administrators](https://dba.stackexchange.com/)
- [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)
- [Software Engineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/)

After investigating the website, we decided that we can use tags in categorizing content. We can take a look at the database schema [here](https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new).

Some other tables that might be interesting other than tags:
- Posts: includes information about Id, PostTypeId, CreationDate, Score, ViewCount, Tags, AnswerCount, FavoriteCount
- Users: includes information about views, upvotes/downvotes, user's reputation score, user's location
- Comments: score and content

The Posts table includes most of the information we want that shows how popular the post is.
We're only interested in recent posts, so we'll limit our analysis to 2019.

Deep learning was a very trending topic in the data science stack exchange from the beginning. Even if it is not trending now, but it hit a plateau, it doesn't seem that the interest in the topic is decreasing.

In conclusion, to answer the question we asked in the beginning: "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" we could safely say that Deep Learning is a good topic to choose and recommend to the company to create content in the future.
